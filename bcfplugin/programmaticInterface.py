**** Description ****
The programmaticInterface is like the brain of the whole plugin. It is were
everything from the frontend comes together and gets distributed to the
backend.
It fulfills two purposes:
    - providing an interface for controlling the plugin over the CLI
    - providing a library for the GUI part of the plugin, to access the data
      model.

Every function in here operates on `curProject`, which is the active instance
of the data model. No object of the data model is passes to the frontend,
rather for every retrieve operation a deepcopy of the result is created. This
ensures that the programmaticInterface remains in full control of the data
model at every point in time.
